dataset_utils.py

This module contains helper functions and a simple DataSet class used for the
Naive Bayes assignment. It provides functions to:
  - Load a CSV dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Compute the Gaussian probability.
  - Wrap a DataFrame in a DataSet class with necessary attributes and methods.
